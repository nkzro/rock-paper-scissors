# rock-paper-scissors
In this project, I create an interactive project where a user can play rock, paper, scissors with a computer using javascript. The major skills 
that were handy in making this project were:

-Functions
-DOM Manipulation
-Event Handling
-(and of course) Googling

Feel free to preview my project using the link below.
